💀 SkullMarketplace

SkullMarketplace is a decentralized NFT marketplace built on Ethereum.

It allows users to mint NFTs and interact directly with smart contracts through a modern Web3 frontend.

All marketplace logic is executed on-chain via Solidity smart contracts.

This project was built to practice full-stack Web3 development: NFT standards, marketplace mechanics, contract architecture, and real-time frontend synchronization.
